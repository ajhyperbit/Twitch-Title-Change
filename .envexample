#To get a client ID and secret go to:
#https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/create
#Name it whatever you want, I selected AJAPInterface
#OAuth Redirect URLs must be:
#http://localhost:8090
#Category: Website Integration
#Client Type: Confidential

TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=ClientIDHere
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=ClientSecretHere

#After that, run twitch_generate_token.py, authorize in the browser window that pops up
#That should populate a twitch_token.json within the same directory
#If it doesn't, DM me

#Change this to your username:
BROADCASTER_USERNAME=your_user_here

#If you want this to update some time other than every 30 min, change this:
UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES=30

#To set your title elements:
#If your title was:
#YOLK OR TREAT DAY 1/2 - 20 SUBS = YOUR OWN DRAWN YOLK [!PP !WOOD !MILKIES !MOBILE ]
#You'd want "YOLK OR TREAT DAY 1/2 - " without the quotes, this part is title 0
#"SUBS = YOUR OWN DRAWN YOLK [!PP !WOOD !MILKIES !MOBILE ]" This part would be title1, again without the quotes
#This is what you want the start of your title to be
Title0=YOLK OR TREAT DAY 1/2 -
#This is the end
Title1=SUBS = YOUR OWN DRAWN YOLK [!PP !WOOD !MILKIES !MOBILE ]

#Number of subs you want to start with
BASE_SUBS=5

#True or False
LINEAR=True 

#Next option only does anything if Linear = False
BASE_MULT=2 #Multiple of number of subs you want to add to the counter (2 = *2, 4 = *4, etc)
