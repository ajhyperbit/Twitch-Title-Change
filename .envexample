############### TITLE VARIABLES ###############

#If you want this to update some time other than every 30 min, change this:
UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES=30

#To update the title, you need to add a digit to insert after, so with an example:
#YOLK OR TREAT DAY 1/2 - 5 SUBS = YOUR OWN DRAWN YOLK [!PP !WOOD !MILKIES !MOBILE ]
#If you want to update the 5, you need to count how many space delimited words, so after 6 words you want the number there.
#Note: do not include the number inside the title variable
title="YOLK OR TREAT DAY 1/2 -  SUBS = YOUR OWN DRAWN YOLK [!PP !WOOD !MILKIES !MOBILE ]"
insert_after=6

#Number of subs you want to start with
BASE_SUBS=5

#Maximum number of subs you want to make the title change to
MAX_SUBS=100

#True or False
LINEAR=True

#Next option only does anything if Linear = False
BASE_MULT=2 #Multiple of number of subs you want to add to the counter (2 = *2, 4 = *4, etc)
